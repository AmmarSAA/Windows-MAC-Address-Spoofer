MAC address spoofing is a technique used to alter the unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) on a device. Each NIC has a Media Access Control (MAC) address assigned by the manufacturer, which serves as a unique identifier for that device on a network.

By altering the MAC address of a device, a user can effectively conceal their true identity on the network, allowing them to operate anonymously or circumvent network restrictions. This can be accomplished through the use of specialized software or manually by modifying the device's network settings.

MAC address spoofing is a common practice used in security and privacy-conscious environments, where maintaining anonymity and avoiding detection are essential. However, it can also be used maliciously to bypass security measures or conduct illegal activities on a network. As such, it is important to use this technique responsibly and within the bounds of the law.
